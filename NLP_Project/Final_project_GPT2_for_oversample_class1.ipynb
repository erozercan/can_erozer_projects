Colin Farrell is ludicrously miscast, with black eyebrows and blond ill-fitting fright-wig, so that it's just very hard to look at him at any point during this painfully long film. None of the other Macedonian warriors look so absurd. Why? I'll just leave it there. In the battle-scenes with stirring music he's still badly choreographed and too short compared to the extras. QUO VADIS way back when in BW; with Peter Ustinov as Nero was better for decadence at court. This is just a very very bad film.An infinitely more nuanced, indeed fascinating portrait of this time is the recent book DIVIDING THE SPOILS, by British historian Robin Waterfield, which deals with what happened to the vast territories conquered by Alexander in the years immediately following his death.Oliver Stone no doubt remains a very rich man despite wasting many millions on this film.

I popped in a different Blu-Ray movie and the picture on that was perfect. The problem is this transfer and whatever it is they've done to it.The picture is so streaky and smeary, it looks like a  year old VHS tape that has literally been played about  times.

I was about to throw up after  minutes and couldn't take any more. The cinematography is even worse. some of the worst angles, light dark problems, etc. I've ever seen. I'm convinced games like Doom took their idea from this movie. there are shots where you are following guns around and watching them shoot people.Another reviewer mentioned that High Schoolers could make better movies.

The mental case here is government who outlaw sex and expect their subjects be asexual and behave like robots.

This was supposed to be a comedy movie, but there was a point in that and it was a failure. I didn't like the overall theme and plot of it, but it did work as a comedy. Unfortunately, I couldn't enjoy the entire show because I had to watch a bunch of bad jokes and the comedy wasn't enjoyable. What was enjoyable, even if I wanted something a little more serious, was the jokes about what happened with the girls, and the girls don't seem to notice this film. It was supposed to be more of a humorous attempt at humor. It did the job, but there were too many bad laughs and the ending never seemed to be anywhere near that funny. The show itself was more about humor than anything else, and the story was a total waste of time.\n"

I will say that it is funny but I can't watch the video because I am a comedy fan.This is about all of it because I am bored and the plot is stupid. I will be returning to my review here but the reviews are mostly the stupid ones.\n"

The acting was just as bad as most people in this story because I was so sure the movie would be great. The camera angles looked cool in the movie, but in the film, the characters were so low, and so the scene was so lame it had to have been filmed on a standard standard DVD that had  cameras, and this set was cut to look more like a normal print! This was  minutes long, and was way long after it started, the movie was like one hour long. Really, you can't be too much of a spoiler about the story.

It's like the people from the early  on in it that they actually ran the show to the theater with lots of them trying to watch it. So even if they were not at the theaters, I would have stopped. I still remember the first time I saw it. It was good but the movie was poorly executed and the actors didn't make good movies.The whole thing sucked.The script is just plain bad.I felt ripped off at first, but when I went to watch it again I was happy.

But I can see why Hollywood had the audacity to use the term 'horror' and why the film was the most depressing ever directed by a talented writer. I mean to look at some Hollywood movies like Woody Allen's Dracula of the Dead, The Last Time To Kill, and a film I like but the film, itself is not scary at all, even the fact of its existence, is the only major issue. Why? There are so many movies about the killer, most of which were made in  that were scary and only the worst, not the most stupid.I'm not joking. I know Hollywood has a reputation of wasting time on anything but bad movies. There are movies like The Village, when it's supposed to be a good movie, it's a bad one, as well as the movies made by people who could't act or act and could easily act. So to say it's one\n"

The DVD has no background of background story line, no story line that is even remotely similar to the scenes I read from the books, and it just shows us a bunch of bad actors. Do you want a film that starts out bad, and drags on, and never really is the story line interesting any further, as it appears like it never started before at all? I guess this is not the case. And I'd like to believe there isn't a single plot line that you could ever really relate with in a movie like this. There's no suspense or emotional interest whatsoever.

The zombie movie was about the death of the zombies. It's supposed to be about a person trapped in a zombie bunker. It is not. The original  film of Zombie movies is about zombies being found in the abandoned areas of Zonne's home town, in the city that's where zombies are found. This story was based on the same story as that film. So why the zombie thing really happened? The zombies are in the house in the first place and are living in the underground underground underground. The zombie has apparently killed a zombie that's inside in another room. Of course it's true. They're in the same bed as the movie. So who killed the zombie? The original  zombie movie is about zombies eating zombies, and not only living in zombies. And the zombie movie was just one\n"

The special effects are poor at best and seem cheap at best. The acting is poor at best, especially as the actors appear to have no range or range of emotions throughout. It is possible that this film is based on true events, but there is no context to the events and it does not add up to the whole experience. This film also fails in its attempts at humor. While there is some funny moments in this film with some humor, it is also very dry and depressing. You will probably not have to pay to see this movie at the theatre.\n"

For someone to write a review that seems to be of the same quality as other blu ray transfers, then they should be in great condition on all aspects of the blu ray. It seems that the quality of blu ray is too low-to-existent for Blu Ray, and so is the quality of DVD. I just can't believe that there is such a high level of pixelization in this blu ray. There is not much difference between the two films, which seems to be a result of several different factors, like the fact that they are just trying to minimize their work by adding some pixelization. This also results in some of the worst Blu ray presentations I have ever had problems. This Blu ray is very poor quality especially with the exception of the special features for adjusting the contrast and contrast. I would love to know if this Blu Ray version is worse than I am. I love the old Blu\n"

I rented this film and couldn't bear to view it without thinking twice, but once I open the dvd player, I find a tiny small plastic bag holding a few episodes of the program on it, and my hopes go with this. This was probably one of the funniest, most unintentionally funny, most lame, most laughable parts of the program. My girlfriend and I were even laughing during the first few minutes of the film, because we were on the airplane, and we were both laughing. No one could save this film from a total loss of all its wonderful humor! The humor was ridiculous, especially considering the title, which was funny in the most funny, but also because of the title, it actually is really boring! It is too late in the comedy department to truly have an audience, so instead, it just becomes a cartoonishly ridiculous and cliched piece of art that would cause even a twelve year old to laugh at the parts the comedians do;\n"

However, this is far from satisfactory.First of all the cover art looks pretty pretty creepy. It's about an old girl who runs a fitness company with her little son and the manager, who is really strange considering how old she is and running. She is having too much sex with men at parties, especially among young women and children. This is the reason I was not looking for this movie. I had expected a lot more from this movie than I expected.What I found strange is that the movie was directed by a guy named David Hasselhoff. They make interesting points and situations for the characters. But they go way to long for what they're trying to say.I think the main reason I disliked this movie is because they didn't show the young women in the same room, so it would have been an interesting movie.

For example, I realize the original TV show had some good scripted plots, but this one just isn't. It's a lot of movies in many places that had no reason for a place in the theater system. For example, the movie was filmed in the house of the original TV show's house where the TV station usually filmed shows over the night, a rarity that the new TV show would have had.

I don't care if the characters are the same, or that they are different, the story just kind of branches out and there are no real characters.The problem with this film is that you have to put the entire story in the background, as opposed to the original film. The whole cast in this film, as well as the rest of the cast in the previous film, obviously felt a need to constantly under-act the story, to make the character seem weak and a little over-dimensional.The cast in the first film are as good as they come, the first film was just as good as the one I saw.

In the last  minutes of the film when they started talking about aliens vs humans and that was  minutes too long. The plot is bad, most of the dialogue is unintelligible and unintelligent.

I'm just amazed that they didn't just add  different aliens and use a different plot?

Apparently that means the producer was drunk, thus rendering it impossible to tell that the audience was actually watching something. I was also shocked that the producers tried to make the show a comedy. Not only was it boring and the whole premise was so backwards and backwards that it was really hard to enjoy it, it was way more like having an hour and a half of your life back.

Don't waste your time watching this movie, unless you enjoy senseless, annoying, and incredibly moronic writing. Movies produced using the works of Stephen King are typically quite awful. The only exceptions include movies that are based on short stories and movies that he himself did not have much to do with. This probably has something to do with the fact that he churns out mindless works one after another, much to the delight of his lowest common denominator audience. Save yourself the time and watch Magnolia.\n",
            "1: Could not get interested in this replacement for two really good series I managed to watch a little over half of the series pilot during it's first airing on syfy channel. Later, I gave it another try during a repeat airing and got to the end. I'm not able to say that this encouraged me to watch further. SG-U suffers from serious problems. For one, it focuses on uncharismatic characters played by unskilled, uncharismatic actors. This makes it dull, and I couldn't care about any of them, even in dramatic situations. Nor was I comfortable when a crude sex scene suddenly came on screen. Not a show for children, and maybe not for adults who like their science fiction to be SF and not a soap opera. Too, the pilot had a lot of hysteria. Shrieking, screaming, sobbing. This definitely made me miss the rationality of the SG- or Atlantis crew. Trivial guest appearances by these actors characters don't help the series at all. I began to find it not just dull but embarrassing. I confess that I have only watched one additional episode, after which I gave this entire show a miss. I don't doubt that the DVD set has the high quality of the previous Stargate sets, but to me, the show itself isn't worth purchasing, whether it's a half season or a whole. Anyone who hasn't seen SG- or Atlantis, I highly encourage to look at the complete sets for these series. You will not be disappointed.\n",

Supposedly this was Farley's last film, he should have quit a LONG time agoIt is NOT funny or even mildly amusing, just a load of overdone juvenile humor and labored slapstick.

That'd take me into my  But at this rate, it could take more than  years to release the entire series. The same thing was done with other classic Westerns like Rawhide.
