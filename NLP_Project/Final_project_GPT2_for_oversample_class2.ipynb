              "[\"An Unexplained Anime Review I was very anxious to see the Uncut version of Kite, or kee-tay as I called it, and I finally manage to see that Anime, but when I see the entire movie.man, it was very hard to explain. First off, the plot is very questionable, this movie has got to be the first I've ever seen that deals with a lot of.'DEPTH'. There are still many things in this movie that I still don't understand What's the real reason that Akai wants Sawa to assasinate certain innocent people, why can Sawa just have the heart to decide not to kill those people and find a solution to that, and mainly, why Akai killed Sawa's parents? There are many more questions unanswered, but I don't want to spoil it to the people, all I can say is that none of this makes sense, except for the fact that Akai is a perverted, child-raping nutcase! The animation and characters in this anime is good, but not at a same level as 'Ghost In The Shell', and everything else..just forget it!Overall.this is very hard to give the final result for 'Kite' uncensored. I watched it so many times, and this whole excessive-meaningless gory violence and the whole child pornography of this Anime still doesn't help me understand this. For now, I give this  stars, because.well I don't know. This movie is just too much for me.\",\n",
              " \"Disappointing Night Saw this film recently on Showtime and it was based on the fact that John Malkovich was in it but unfortunately it is primarily a cameo of about  minutes of screen time. The kidnapping of a little girl from her San Diego home was harrowing to say the least and the acting from Tom Arnold as the abductor and Jeremy Sisto, Harold Perrineau as his confederates was also very good but the film just dragged on to its dismal conclusion. I often wonder what the filmmakers intent was to have such an un resolved ending? I was hoping that the female, now a teenager would slowly be indoctrinated back into her family. What's also missing from this disappointing film is that we are not shown what the abductors did when she reached the teen age or how she was dumped back into society. So basically the blame is on the writer and director of this film rather than the actors the actress playing grown teenage girl lacks a center in her acting.\",\n",
              " \"It was just okay. The end of the film has modern commentary that the director wanted to make a film of Jesus without commentary or additions but that's exactly what he did. For example, with the adulterous woman, Jesus never said You've judged her correctly; she has sinned. He only writes on the ground and says whomever has not sinned to stone her first. Is this significant? Could be. Remember that they only brought the woman, where was the man with whom she was allegedly caught? God's Law requires that TWO witnesses be presented and that BOTH adulterers be stoned. Were there two witnesses? Where was the man? Something to think about.Those kinds of little things happened througout the movie and bothered me as a believer. Why not just stick to the original text?! The modern film The Gospel of John, I'd recommend instead.\",\n",
              " 'Not my pick on a good pilates workout I would not recommend this to a beginner or anyone else.unless you have done pilates and know the exact form.The Rapid Results Pilates video is comprised of  sections  Super toned buns and thighs Arms and shoulder shaper Waist slimmer Total body blast Slim and sleek stretchSeeming like an aerobics video performed horizontally on a mat, there was no talk of pilates principles or breathing. A few exercises were too advanced to not include instruction on alignment which could result in injury for the newcomer.The second section uses light weights which gives an extra challenge. However, I would never recommend anyone watch a pilates video which utilizes weights but forgoes pilates principles about alignment. Not only will the viewers not gain all that they can out of their workout, but it is dangerous.In sum not recommended. Pace Good Level Intermediate Clear breath cuing No Inclusion of pilates principles No Explanation of the goals of an exercise No What you get out of doing an exercise No Target muscles Very few Common errors in specific exercises None',\n",
              " \"Has it's share of laughs, but goes overboard with Carell's character The first  minutes of this film are very very funny and seemed to indicate that this film was moving in a positive direction. However, soon after Rudd meets Carell's character the idiot formula gets very stale very quickly. Carell's character is so bad in fact, that he can only be tolerated in small doses, something lost on the scriptwriter and director of this movie.This movie should have been primarily about Rudd interspersed with smatterings of Carell, the bumbling idiot, at his side. However, once Carell comes on screen he never leaves for the rest of the movie. And that is really what brings the movie down to the point of being almost unwatchable. Thankfully it manages to tie things together nicely at the end in a cute and humorous way, but it still doesn't make up for half the movie being some of the worst film making I've ever seen.I was tempted to deliver a one star rating on this one, but I have to be honest and say that some moments are genuinely funny and I found myself laughing quite a bit. However, I found myself equally cursing the film during it's midpoint lull of horrible comedy that few would find funny. I recommend renting this one so you can fast forward through these painfully bad scenes.Strangely enough, the feel good message of the film seemed to be lost on the audience. There was something highly ironic about a film teaching us to be kind to idiots while using those same idiots to generate all of it's laughs.Honestly there was a great film somewhere amidst the rubble, but it just got completely bungled by moving the focus too much on Carell's stupidity and not enough on Judd's transformative journey.On a final note I also want to add that Jemaine Clement is, as always, completely brilliant in this film in the role of Kieran.\",\n",

The trailer for this movie actually looked great and I was very excited to see it. but the movie was slow, and unappealing for the most part. Like all Will Ferrell movies, it had some fantastic moments. A couple of LOL moments, but overall, the movie was pretty bad. It's funny, because I hadn't seen a Will Ferrell movie I didn't like, so I watched it again  days later to make sure I wasn't missing something! Sadly, I liked it even less the  time. \",\n",

The movie started out pretty good, but after he was sent down to earth we found out that Thor and Portman's character had zero chemisrty and the brother twist was revealed, it got really boring.

            "0:  surroundThe film is a total waste If this review has you in a good mood, you will fall in love with a certain piece of action film. In fact, I would have loved it to be the best movie ever produced. The film is full of a good mix of slapstick humor, action sequences and intense fighting. It's an example of when the filmmakers tried to make a story for each genre to be one with the other, and to connect each film with reality. This is what makes the entire film so funny and so funny. It works with my tastes. The characters are pretty predictable, and the action is very short and almost pointless, though the rest of the time it doesn't bother my tastes. There is little in the movie that could make you fall asleep with any interest. I could watch this as soon as I get on it. It just doesn't make it worth buying. It goes nowhere fast.It is a movie about the effects. You don't see it any\n"

I like to laugh, too. As someone who like a good story, I really wanted to like this one as soon as possible. And so, I gave it two stars instead of one; so, it was a bit more fun seeing the movie from the other viewpoint.

When the studio was first introduced the story involved a family of three friends who were taking care of their three young daughters in their new home. They were told that they were going to rent out their home which the children had already purchased. That the family was getting so close to being killed. They saw something happen to the family and left them, thinking that it was all about a young girl, who would help them get away from the house. It seems that this story is only being told to a small circle of film students, who do not have money and who do not have room or even a living room and living room. That's why the film students do not get much screen time. In order to get to the film students, they meet the young girl. Their mother, who is trying to help the family, decides to send\n"

The acting is not bad in this film, however, and the movie has good material as well as a good story line.

However, to say that the movie was good was a let down, and the movie itself was not the best either, it certainly was not the best either. Unfortunately, one star, perhaps more, and one star is enough to help make this flick a decent movie, and one star simply isn't enough.

I don't even think they thought the film should be titled the Omen-Beneath a la The Birds and The Seeker at all. In truth, this is a pretty standard version of a film like that, and a little bit like the previous two films made about the same theme, and a lot of people have taken that idea and applied it to the film, and just not really thought there was much room for them in making a movie like this.So I was happy to hear out the reviews that I was involved with, and the acting did really well and I liked the idea of the two.

Wayne seems to be more concerned with creating suspense rather than suspense, with his usual calm demeanor and a natural intelligence quot;hearing quot; the quot;humor quot; and this time he just doesn't seem to have the brain cells to listen to his new friends' comments. Wayne simply doesn't get that psychological resonance throughout the series which would probably prove to be what this series was all about.

I wanted the best part to be used, and I was disappointed. I'm glad I didn't spend all of the money I just spent purchasing the DVD. The movie did have a few funny moments and was very entertaining. I will admit, my opinion hasn't changed much. I don't think it would be fair on a film with such a bad film. That's the problem I have with it. It does not hold me in the mind.The DVD transfer itself was OK. The film had a  disc image, but it only had  disc space. They went on and on about  minutes at the end but in the DVD transfer itself the transfer was ok for the most part. I like the picture and did not waste anything on the DVD transfer itself.\n"

The girl is not so sure what to do after this encounter. In this version, Jack Sholder plays Jack, the bad guy who lives in a mansion and does not know what he is doing. The only thing in this film that he seems to do was take all the money the town gives him and toss it away in a private motel. It becomes a bit of a challenge to pay for thiserous, cruel and insensitive act of mind.The story of Jack Sholder starts with his brother who, after finding a book online at his local college, decides to read the novel. Since he reads it, he believes he can find someone worthy to steal him. The story follows, however, throughout his days. There is no way to tell who he is.\n"

It seemed like the first  or  minutes or so of this film just didn't take itself too seriously. The two leads were good enough, I just couldn't get into the whole film. They made it sound like a big movie. There is one  minute and twenty minutes worth of story. A lot of it takes itself too seriously. We expected some decent dialogue and some very cute costumes. We just couldn't get into any of these characters. There is one saving grace of this film.\n"

            "0:  TitleWhy? Why the sudden popularity of this film? What film did the film makers make as a sequel to, and how? Well, this could have easily been a comedy, with a better story and a better plot.The best thing about this film is that the actors did their best to make the film about the importance of the death of someone who is not only the victim of an act. In fact, I find myself rooting for them to die. This has a very similar effect to the way Michael Douglas plays an old Scottish, played by Richard Jenkins, plays the same role played by Peter Sellers, in The Graduate. In the latter role, the actor plays a young man, played by Patrick Wilson, who is a young man living with his grandmother. He gets on well with Wilson, and he figures out a way to save the father's life. The movie is not about the death of the young man, but it is about the suicide of the mother. Why is that so\n"

It is based around the story of a lesbian couple who is lost in the middle of nowhere. The story is about a couple of lonely men who go to Paris with their beautiful women in tow and have issues about intimacy. But it is not realistic and this is not an enjoyable romantic comedy. It is the story of the couple that I wanted to like and they have a nice little apartment. So they go back to looking for a real connection and that part of it is taken seriously. It was hard to follow what was going on with this movie. It's really the story of a woman struggling with a loss of her intimacy with other men. It was hard to follow any of the characters because they were unlikable and not as appealing as they could be. The story was about the relationship\n"

The main reason is for it being a little too dull and not interesting enough and it goes without saying that the animation is top-rate. If you enjoy this then you will probably like this. If you don't, you will probably like it less and less. The only reason it fails is the poor decision of the cast. It is a simple storyline which should not be in any way a bad thing because it is not very well written. The characters are weak. The acting is stiff. The storyline is weak. It is not very innovative. Some things are not really thought out much but they are thrown together in the hopes of creating a better movie. The action is slow and lacks a sense of urgency. I will be watching more and wanting to finish watching something. For example the death of the main character at the end, I was watching it expecting more\n"

However, unlike with so many of the other main characters of this book, the actors do a very poor job and are all way too stereotypic in their stereotypes to give this flick any chance of saving it for me. They should have gotten some serious literary work out of this. If you really wish to find a story that is worth reading and for the most part you can find it here. Otherwise if you want a movie that you can watch over and over, but not long enough to have fun, then this movie might be for you.\n"

It starts out on the bad-guy side and goes downhill and the bad guy is very much like a giant spider, one with one sided intelligence and a very sadistic personality. Well, this doesn't mean he is a bad actor, but as he ages, the bad guy begins to change. What's the reason the bad guy becomes sympathetic? Some of the actors are playing against stereotypes, but they can't stay close to their characters. Maybe this is a fault of the director, as the film is set in the present day, but that's all it has. There's a nice shot of a robot doing what it's built to do, but the plot of THE GOOD ASKERS is way out of control that is hard to understand.

I finally did, and I still don't find it really enjoyable. Unfortunately, if you've never seen a DVD this lame, and I still can't recommend it, check out Avatar or Cinderella II, but if you have, look elsewhere. The story is pretty shallow, the animation is okay, and the scenery is pretty good. Disney's Vacation, by itself, is actually quite decent, but don't expect to be entertained by the rest of the terrible DVD- distribution.

But if you like high effects, then you will too, I mean you won't find any here. The problem is really the lead actress, a very attractive kid and some kind of evil eye of hers.The storyline is quite weak, however I feel like I was watching some great B-movies or a B-grade movie with a very good director.\n"

I have watched every SyFy and Efron film I have purchased, and have to say that I am NOT disappointed! Even though I love all three of them as SyFy is a great actor, I cannot believe the other two can actually be this bad. The acting is terrible, and the fight sequences are just not very good. The most memorable scene of the film is the fight in a restaurant. The last  minutes of the film are so bad it is laughable.

I was also somewhat unimpressed with this movie because it seemed to have very long stretches where you barely get a good look into what is going on. I am not usually a fan of the supernatural, but I had a hard time watching it. The only other movie that did have a good story was Paranormal Activity I, which contained some interesting creepy scenes and although I am not quite sure what it was, I could not quite figure out why it was even there. After talking to people about the ending, I finally felt that the movie was a little bit over-acted and just a little too much hype.I am not saying this is everything you expect from a scary movie, but I will warn you that it is very bad, just not very good. The hype just seemed to be getting way too\n"

Because Fox News Channel didn't want to. The series just had to get rid of the last few episodes. Why? Because it is  BBC series called quot;Full Frontal.quot; They could've just gone away with a better series to make more money.

It's interesting to see the youth generation going through some difficult times. I didn't like their antics, especially in the Mexican and American markets. There's a lot of drug and pornography, and they definitely weren't the ideal parents of their young kids. So as a result, I wasn't impressed and ultimately turned away from the Tijuana Brass Band. My daughter summed up the movie pretty succinctly. No kidding. No talking heads, no actual musicians playing, no nudity, none. This movie is nothing but a reaffirmation of the band's success. Not that it didn't succeed and I'm sorry that I did. But I'm not going to sit through this review again because I'll have to give the impression that it's mostly forgettable.\n"

The acting is good and there's no violence as they act their parts fine but the plot is lame and the movie just fizzles out and there really isn't a reason to watch it and if you like it and hate it dont watch it.\n"

It also felt thrown together and not well rehearsed with number dragging on longer than they should and others rushed. Rachel York was OK she was better in Scarlet Pimpernelbut this is not her best performance at all.All in all a disponting version and hard to see how it won a Tony for best revival..but then this isn't the original cast from that Tony winning revival so that may be the problem.\n",

            "4: Film Needs A Vial of Billy Bob's LIfe Blood Lara Croft Angelina Jolie is entering a tomb, trying to get to a jewel placed on a pedestal. As she makes her way towards the jewel, a large metal creature unsurfaces and she has to fight it to the death. After she does disable the creature, she retrieves the jewel which is actually a computer chip containing 'Lara's Party Mix', which she plays on the sound system in her mansion. The tomb was actually a training room built in her large English mansion. Soon, Lara discovers a clock hidden under a staircase by her deceased father Jon Voight, Jolie's real father. The clock started ticking exactly one week before a complete solar eclipse is scheduled to happen. Inside the clock, she finds a dial, which when combined with a mythical triangle which has, incidentally, been broken in half, gives the holder power over time. The holder can move back and forth within history, changing things. Naturally, a mysterious society, the Illuminata, headquartered in Venice, Italy, wants the device and hires Manfred Powell Iain Glen to retrieve it. Manfred hires Alex Marrs Daniel Craig, Croft's former nemesis and fellow Tomb Raider to help him. Lara can't let the Illuminata gain control of the device.Lara Croft Tomb Raider is the latest example of why Hollywood should not adapt video games into films. No more successful than Super Mario Brothers, Tomb Raider will probably gross more than  million dollars because it caters so brilliantly to the pre-teen boy audience that loves the video game.The film is filled with action set pieces, which look incredibly like set pieces. Each of the scenes is shot on a set. Each begins with the characters entering a room, tomb, cave, etc. and then, voila, they start fighting something, someone, each other. This creates a very claustrophobic feel which does not translate well to the big screen.The film was reportedly shot on location in Greenland and a sacred temple in Thailand ?. If this is the case, the filmmakers did a very bad job of taking advantage of the natural scenery.Jolie certainly fits the physical description of Lara Croft. She has the same voluptuous curves that the video game vixen uses to make grown men addicts of her adventures. I have never played the video game, so I am unsure whether Lara Croft is supposed to look so bored throughout. Jolie smirks and does little else to make the character seem believable. It appears as though the vial of Billy Bob's blood that she reportedly carries around her neck was missing most days when she shot her part. Where would they hide it? Jolie wears a series of skin tight t-shirts and short-shorts to reveal all of her assets.It was no suprise to see that the filmmaker's managed to include a shower scene. After all, Croft is an archaeologist and needs to be squeaky clean for all of that roughhousing. I only wish they had managed to get a couple of shower scenes into the Indiana Jones films. NOT. As the film is PG, they only show Jolie from the neck up. Boy that water cascading down her hair and lips and neck looks sexy. Strangely, a little later in the film, Alex Marrs gets equal treatment. His shower scene is virtually identical to Croft's. Thank goodness for equal opportunity. I'm sure all of the little  year old boys in the audience will love to see a half naked man showering and then walking around his hotel room.The other big problem with Tomb Raider is that we never actually see Croft engaging in any archaeology or tomb raiding, until the climax. Why is she so famous? What special skills does she have? Apparently, she can jump around on bungee cords and kill metal beasts quite well, but what about archaeology draws her into it? Apparently, nothing.Oh, wait, there is another big problem. After the device is assembled big surprise, I'm sure, Croft is told that she can't use it for a personal reason and then does any way. Huh? I wasn't even aware that she liked the person she uses it for.Oh, oh, another problem. Oh, enough. Tomb Raider is a sloppy mess of an excuse for filmmaking. Will certainly join Pearl Harbor as one of the worst films of the summer if not the year.\n",

I found the battles boring and uninteresting.

            "7: Harrison Ford still kicks butt but Firewall is basically what you've seen too many times before Harrison Ford Hollywood Homicide, Star Wars A New Hope plays Jack Stanfield who is the big CEO of the bank and whose world turns upside down when Bill Cox, played Paul Bettany The Reckoning, upcoming Da Vinci Code in a disappointing performance, and some of his men, take hostage Ford's wife, played by Virginia Madsen Sideways, Candyman, his daughter, played by Carly Schroeder Mean Creek and his son, played by Jimmy Bennett Hostage, Everwood. I guess Bettany wants Ford to hack into his own system so that he can steal some money and wire it to his offshore accountants and if Ford doesnt cooperate, what will happen? I dont know, I guess it's the old trick in the book, threaten to kill the family. Bascially it all leads up to a showdown between the badguy and the good guy.

            "9: You Have Be From Mars If You Like This Movie! When this movie first came out I had no interest at all in seeing this movie. It's not that I don't like Brian De Palma, because he's made some films I truly like, for example quot;The Untouchablesquot;, or quot;Mission Imposiblequot;. But this film didn't grab my attention. And after watching the movie, I can tell my instincts were right! Now if your one of the quot;smartquot; people who avoided this movie, and are thinking about renting it, after reading my review, you might change your mind. First lets start out with the acting. With the names involved you might think this will turn out to be a good movie, I mean we have Gary Sinise, Tim Robbins, Connie Nielsen Who was much better in quot;Gladiatorquot;,Don Cheadle, and Jerry O' Connell. But from everyone I mentioned, not one of them stand out. There's no memorble moments here. Nothing you see will stay with you after wards. Unlike Kubrick's quot; A Space Odysseyquot;, which is what this movie aims at. But I will refrain from comparing the two in my review. Since I am going to judge this movie purely on it's OWN merit. I can think of only one scene that sticks out in my head maybe because I just watched the movie lol, and I'm sure after  or  minutes that too will leave my memory. It deals with Nielsen and Robbins, I don't want to give it away, but it's full of emotion. Now, maybe the reason for such forgettable performances is due to this lack luster screenplay, which is written by Jim and John Thomas and Graham Yost. I personally have never heard of any of them, and I'm sure their names will not be remember by any for this screenplay. Some say it's too slow. I didn't see it that way, I just thought it was dumb, plain and simple. And I can't understand how they came up with the end of this movie. It left me shocked, but not in a good way. It wasn't something thought provoking. Watch the movie and you'll see what I'm talking about. The quot;ailenquot; in the movie is laughable. We see all these wonderful effects in this movie which is the ONLY good thing about this film! and then we see this quot;ailenquot;. Where did they go wrong! The ending is one of the worst I've ever seen, not THE worst but one of the worst. It's completely stupid! Now, if all this doesn't seem bad enough, I have to talk about De Palma's directing. The movie quot;feelsquot; like he wasn't even there. I can't imagine him directing this. It doesn't have his touch. All in all my opinion on this film is, while it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, it's certainly is far from one of the best. Good special effects, decent acting, and no memeorable scenes. If your looking for a good sci-fi movie get the obvious, quot; A Space Odysseyquot;.  out of \n"

Without giving away too much too easily the filmmakers try to show you what could happen in real life. You do not believe the events that they show, but do not believe what they say or feel about those who are shown. Without giving away too much about some people who are shown the documentaries you do not believe. A documentary on the subject could tell us little about some people who live in America and live near the edge of the cities. Without giving away too much, the filmmakers show us a society where drugs are rampant, where violence is commonplace, where women are promiscuous, and where men feel inferior in every way because of the way they dress.In fact this documentary is far more interesting than any documentary on that subject. The film is shown in many small rooms with very little press and a very small room that contains a very thin but interesting documentary, on a separate disc. The movie takes a short cut for the most part and is told with much more urgency. In short this DVD is not worth a lot.\n",
